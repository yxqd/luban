core:
* move current docs to timber/docs, and write the docs for luban core
* think about notification -- "event" global?
* move to most recent jquery so we can remove the alert on msie/opera


Proposal about events:
* make each event a class with descriptors of attributes
* make event handler a special descriptor type that can check for the
  assigned action and make sure event.<x> is valid
* autogenerate event handler descriptor from event classes for 
  an element
