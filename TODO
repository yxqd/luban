Director:


Widgets
 * clean up the "notification" types. (search for $(...).data('...-data', ...) in javascripts/luban/widgets
 * SplitSection:
  * should remove the "size" property. size should be set with style sheets
 * Table:
  * improve tabulator.js to reduce the amount of data passing from server to client
 * Form:
  * FormSubmitButton: consider rename "help" to "tip"
 * tip: should make tip a luban widget

Actions:
 * check all element-actions for all element types
 * (partially done for form fields) new actions: enable/disable

Compatibility:
 * IE (not urgent, but still important)

Docs:
 * tutorial of using credential

Javascript implementation:
 * should improve implemenation of "destroy" to destroy the jquery ui widgets.
 * should change implementation of "replaceContent" should use destroy to destroy all children and then add new child.

Think about these problems:

 * (partially done) Plugin-like structure. to make it easier to extend luban
 * Action to find children by name (preliminary implementation exists) 
   and find descendent by path (<name1>/<name2>/.../)
 * Validator rendering in javascript
 * python-based server, sessions, etc
