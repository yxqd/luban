Compatibility of luban with major browsers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

 * Firefox: regularly tested for Mac, Windows. tested in Linux
 * Safari: regularly tested (Mac)
 * Google chrome: tested. seems to be working. (Chrome only has Windows version at this moment)
 * Windows IE:  Javascript mostly working, but css does not
   work well. 
   It is in the plan to work on that (http://dev.danse.us/trac/luban/ticket/9).
   Currently if a user usese windows internet explorer to
   open a web site built using luban, he or she will be instructed to
   use a different browser.
