Luban: a generic "language" for creating user interface
=======================================================

Luban is a python package for building user interface. 
For example, with luban, one can quickly create 
dynamic, ajax-based web
interfaces using **pure python**: **no knowledge of html and javascript
is required**; anyone knowing basic python can use luban to
create their user interface applications accessible from web browsers.

Luban is different from any existing web frameworks in philosophy:
it provides a generic "language" for describing user interface
(more details can be found in :ref:`concepts of luban <philosophy>`).

Luban is focused on providing a simple, easy-to-understand syntax to
describe user interfaces, and hence allows users to focus more 
on the business logic needed 
behind user interfaces.
