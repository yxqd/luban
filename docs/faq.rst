Frequently Asked Questions
==========================


Installation
------------

... I got an error of "OSError: [Errno 9] Bad file descriptor" when trying to start a luban project
    You are probably using python 3.2.0, which has a bug in the "webbrowser" package.
    Please update to the most recent version of python 3.2.


... Does luban support python 2?
    Luban mainly supports python 3. 
    Its support of python 2 is pretty good, 
    but still experimental at this moment.

... There are so many web frameworks, why do I need to use luban?
    Luban is not really a web framework. 
    It could be used with any python web frameworks. 
    (In fact, luban is at this moment 
    implemented using cherrypy, a minimalist python web framework.)
    Luban makes it easy for you to create dynamic and powerful 
    web user interface.
