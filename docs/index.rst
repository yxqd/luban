Luban: a generic UI "language"
==============================

Luban is a python package for building user interface. 
For example, with luban, one can quickly create 
dynamic, ajax-based web
interfaces using **pure python**: **no knowledge of html and javascript
is required**; anyone knowing basic python can use luban to
create their user interface applications accessible from web browsers.

Luban provides a generic "language" with simple, natural syntax
for describing user interfaces. 
A quick overview of luban philosophy is here.
