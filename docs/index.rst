Luban: a generic "language" for creating user interface
=======================================================

Luban is a python package for building user interface (web and
native [#nativesupportiscoming]_). 
With luban, one can quickly create 
dynamic, ajax-based web
interfaces using **pure python**: **no knowledge of html and javascript
is required**; anyone knowing basic python can use luban to
create their user interface applications accessible from web browsers.

Luban is different from any existing web frameworks in philosophy:
it provides a generic "language" for describing user interface
(more details can be found in :ref:`concepts of luban <philosophy>`).

.. Luban user interface specifications can be 
.. automatically translated into web or native user interfaces
.. (`Gongshuzi demo <tutorials/video/gongshuzidemo.html>`_).

Luban is focused on providing a simple, easy-to-understand syntax to
describe user interfaces, and hence allows users to focus more 
on the business logic needed 
behind user interfaces.

Although Luban has a simple :ref:`philosophy <philosophy>`
and a simple :ref:`python API <API>`, but it 
can be used to create sophisticated, dynamic, (web) user interfaces
(:ref:`demos <demos>`).
