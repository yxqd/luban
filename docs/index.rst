Luban: a generic UI "language"
==============================

Luban is a python package for building user interfaces. 
For example, with luban, one can quickly create 
dynamic, ajax-based web
interfaces using **pure python**: **no knowledge of html and javascript
is required**; anyone knowing basic python can use luban to
create user interface applications that are accessible from web browsers.

Luban provides 
:ref:`a minimalist "language" <philosophy>`
with simple, natural syntax
for describing user interfaces in a generic way.
