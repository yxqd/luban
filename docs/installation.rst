Installation
============

luban can be installed by pip for **python3**::

 $ pip install luban

You may need super-user privileges to do this.

.. note::
   luban 1.0 for now only supports python 3, and does NOT support python 2.
   Installation/usage of pip for python 3 could be tricky;
   please take a look at the 
   :ref:`installation of pip <install-py3-pip>` for more details.
