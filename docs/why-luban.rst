Why luban is useful for you
===========================

Users who want to create professional web applications
------------------------------------------------------

For those who want to create a professional web interface but
have better things to do than learning html/javascript,
luban is a great choice.
You will only need to learn a bit of python to use luban, 
and the syntax is simple and natural.
The code you will have as a result of using luban will
be clean and clear, and very easy to maintain.
As UI technology evolves, you will not need to change your 
UI code, since all you have are generic specifications of your UI
instead of specific (sometimes nasty) details of UI implementations,
which are taken care of by luban.

.. As an example, while we are all migrating to html5, it would be
.. much easier for a UI application with luban specification to do so.


Developers who are tired of messy UI logic
------------------------------------------

Luban has a intentionally limited, but clean and easy-to-use syntax,
that is dedicated for specification of user interface.
The design of luban encourages UI developers to write
organized code.
Please read :ref:`luban user guide <user-guide>` for more details.


Web app experts
---------------
You can create a UI framework (for your own or for your clients) on top of luban.

See :ref:`advanced topics <advanced-topics>` for more details.



User experience professionals
-----------------------------
Luban has a goal to provide a generic "language" for specifying
user interface without the need to go into details in implementations.
Please read :ref:`luban philosophy <philosophy>` for more details.
