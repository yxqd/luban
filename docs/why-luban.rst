Why luban is useful for you
===========================

Users who have better things to do than learning html/js
--------------------------------------------------------

For users who have better things to do than learning html/javascript,
luban is a natural choice.
You will only need to learn a bit of python to use luban, 
and the syntax is simple and natural.
The code you will have as a result of using luban will
be clean and clear, and very easy to maintain.
As UI technology evolves, you will not need to change your 
UI code, since all you have are generic specifications of your UI
instead of specific (sometimes nasty) details of UI implementations,
which are taken care of by luban.
.. As an example, while we are all migrating to html5, it would be
.. much easier for a UI application with luban specification to do so.

You can create a UI framework (for your own or for your clients) on top of luban.
