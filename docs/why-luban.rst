Why luban is useful for you
===========================

Users who want to create professional web applications
------------------------------------------------------

For those who want to create a professional web interface but
have better things to do than learning html/javascript,
luban is a great choice.
You will only need to learn a little bit of python to use luban, 
and luban's syntax is simple and natural.
The code you will have as a result of using luban will
be clean and clear as well as very easy to maintain.
As UI technology evolves, you will not need to change your 
UI code, since all you have to deal with are generic specifications of your UI,
while specific (and sometimes nasty) details of UI implementations
are taken care of by luban.

.. As an example, while we are all migrating to html5, it would be
.. much easier for a UI application with luban specification to do so.


html/javascript experts
-----------------------
You can create a UI framework (for yourself or for your clients) on top of luban.

See :ref:`advanced topics <advanced-topics>` for more details.


Developers who are tired of messy UI logic
------------------------------------------

Luban has a clean and easy syntax dedicated to the specification
of user interfaces.
