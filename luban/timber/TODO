(this is not everything, of course; just stuff I noticed)

To Do for luban wx weaver:
- 'icon' for treeview, etc. are not implemented
- tip for treeview is a little weird, won't go away

wx actions that don't work/aren't implemented:
- onNotification() -- works for table ('row-changed') and
 accordion('changed') now. 
test accordion's with testaccordion --routine=testonchange in aokuang
- setAttribute() -- works for document title

in wx, onAppend() now works for:
- accordion
- appmenubar, appmenu, etc.
- forms
- tabs
- splitter
- toolbar
- treeview

in wx, onAppend() does not work for:
- portlet

luban web/javascript weaver:
- 'selection' doesn't do anything in formradiobox
