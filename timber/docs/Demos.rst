* `Installation <tutorials/video/installation.html>`_ (31 seconds)

 Install luban and download an example
 project and run it.

* `aokuang: demo of luban API
  <tutorials/video/aokuangdemo-youtube.html>`_ (2:13)

 `aokuang <http://luban.danse.us/aokuang>`_ is a web service that
 serves as a demo of luban
 API, you could :ref:`download and run it in your own computer
 <download-and-run-luban-examples>` or 
 `see it at luban site <http://luban.danse.us/aokuang>`_.
 This video walks through some basic functioinalities of aokuang.

* `Create "Hello World" application from command line
  <tutorials/video/newprojectdemo-youtube.html>`_ (14 seconds)

 Create and run a luban project is easy.

* `Simplest "ORM" <tutorials/video/ormdemo1.html>`_ (34 seconds)

  This is the simplest example of using luban "orm" to map a data
  object to a form. There are much more you can do with luban "orm".

* `Create "Hello World" application using Gongshuzi
  <tutorials/video/gongshuzidemo.html>`_ (5:18)

 :ref:`Gongshuzi <gongshuzichapter>` is an interface builder for
 luban. It itself is created using luban. This demo
 shows how you can create a luban project visually using Gongshuzi, and run the project
 as a native or a web application.
* `Demo of a workflow in the Virtual Neutron Facility (VNF)
  <http://docs.danse.us/VNET/movies/tutorial-matter-bvksim-sample-experiment.html>`_ (11:50)

 `VNF <http://vnf.caltech.edu>`_ is a web application for performing
 virtual neutron experiments. It is built using luban. This 
 video demo contains just one workflow of VNF. VNF is a very dynamic application
 and this demo shows some of the interesting capabilities of luban.

The following are some application examples created using luban
(ordered in increasing complexity and interactivity):

.. * `sansmodel <http://luban.danse.us/sansmodel/v2>`_
.. This is a simple web application that caluclates I(Q) spectrum of a 
.. `sans <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small-angle_neutron_scattering>`_
.. model.

* `plotfx <http://luban.danse.us/plotfx>`_
 This is a simple web service that plot a math function that user
 chooses and customizes. A tutorial of how this application was created is 
 :ref:`here <xyplotter-tutorial>`

* `Jazzclub <http://luban.danse.us/cgi-bin/jazzclub/main.cgi>`_
 This is a simple application for users to post messages. It demos login/logout, table view,
 and form submission.

* `aokuang <http://luban.danse.us/aokuang>`_
 This is an application that demonstrates functionalities of luban
 UI elements (widgets) and actions.

* `Gongshuzi demo site
  <http://luban.danse.us/cgi-bin/gongshuzi/main.cgi>`_  
  (It is just a demo of PARTIAL functionality of :ref:`Gongshuzi
  <gongshuzichapter>`; 
  the real application 
  :ref:`can be run in your own computer <run-gongshuzi>`

  :ref:`Gongshuzi <gongshuzichapter>` is an application for creating
  luban UI.
  This demo shows rich interactivities that can be achieved using luban. 

* `vnf demo site <http://luban.danse.us/cgi-bin/vnfb/main.cgi>`_

 VNF
 is a web application for performing virtual neutron experiments.
 This demo site was an early prototype of VNF and includes 
 a very small set of functionalities of VNF.
 It shows luban can be integrated
 with database backends, and be easily used to develop rich
 interactions with db.
 The real vnf site is at https://vnf.caltech.edu and is much richer.
 Its documentation is at http://docs.danse.us/VNET.
 The real vnf web site is also created using luban, 
 and it is a fully functional
 web portal to high performance scientific computating tools
 for neutron science.
.. VNF is intended to help scientists to perform large-scale, sophisticated simulations.
    In this demo site, you can
     actually prepare for a large ab initio simulation, but unfortunately you are not allowed to submit
      it to our computing cluster to really run it.
