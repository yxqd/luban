Customize your web application
==============================


Cookie
------
You can enable cookie support for better user experiences. 
Cookie is used by luban to cache user's authentication token.
To enable cookie support for your web application, modify the file ::

    config/web-weaver.pml

and add the following::

	<property name="cookie-path">/cgi-bin/</property>
	<property name="use-cookie">on</property>

You have to set "use-cookie" to "on" or "true" or "yes" to enable the cookie support;
the property "cookie-path" should be set to the path of your web application.
For example, if you web application is hosted at ::

  http://my.website.org/cgi-bin/myapp/main.cgi

You should set "cookie-path" to ::

  /cgi-bin/myapp/

You can always set "cookie-path" to ::

  /

if you are lazy, or if all your web applications in this domain "http://my.website.org" share the same authentication service.


Look and feel
-------------
Luban assign special class names to the html elements it created for luban widgets, 
so that you can customize the look and feel of your web application using 
normal css tricks.

The best way to do this customization, in my humble opinion, is to use firebug to investigate
the html elements you need to customize and tweak the css settings with firebug.


Form fields
^^^^^^^^^^^

All luban form fields (FormTextField, FormPasswordField, etc) rendered has class::

  luban-<field-type-name>

For example, a FormTextField is rendered as a "div" that has a class ::

  luban-formtextfield

So to select container divs of all FormTextFields, do ::

  .luban-formtextfield {
  }

To select "input" tag in the container div for a FormTextFields, do ::

  .luban-formtextfield  input {
  }


inline and block
""""""""""""""""
The default css for luban puts the label of the form field and the form field itself in different lines.
You can use "inline" or "block" to put them in the same line.
